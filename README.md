### Notes
* This theme requires the theme "[Bootstrap](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_bootstrap)".  If you're using Moodle auto-updater it will automatically install it too.
* Please do not use the github version of this theme in a production environment.  The current plugin repository version will always be the most stable.
